        <h2>What&rsquo;s this about?</h2>

        <p>
        Tech conference speaker line-ups frequently contain few or no women at all.
        I believe, as many others do, that most conference selection processes are biased towards dominant demographics (you know: men, white, cis, able-bodied) and that addressing and removing this bias is an important part of the battle to increase diversity in the industry at large.
        </p>

        <p>
        I sometimes encounter the argument that speaker line-ups that fail to adequately represent women are not the product of systemic discrimination, but rather an inevitably frequent occurrence in an industry as male-dominated as ours.
        On the face of it, this makes intuitive sense.
        </p>

        Human beings, however, are notoriously bad with probabilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This calculator models the probability distribution for male/female speaker balance assuming random selection, which roughly follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>.
        It was inspired by the work of Dave Wilkinson and Paul Battley, who made similar models and found that the likelihood of an unbiased selection process yielding a line-up with no women at all is far lower than intuition might suggest, and &ndash; depending on the numbers you plug in &ndash; can often be far lower than the likelihood of their <i>over</i>-representation.
        That is to say: <b>in an unbiased selection, you&rsquo;re significantly more likely to see <i>more</i> than the expected number of women than none at all.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
        A caveat: there&rsquo;s no obvious value to use for the percentage of &ldquo;women in tech&rdquo;.
        Wilkinson used 20%, &ldquo;based off of Taubee studies and corroborated by other conferences that achieve speaker lineups with this distribution&rdquo;.
        Battley used 9.1%, based off the number of self-identified female developers in <a href="http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/01.html#gdbjt">A List Apart&rsquo;s annual survey</a>.
        10% is used here as an arbitrary, conservative-feeling number.
        Feel free to plug in anything from Wikipedia&rsquo;s page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">women in computing</a>, if you want to play.

        The statistical modelling technique employed in this calculator has also been used in articles tackling the same biases in physics (see this <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201804/backpage.cfm"> article in the American Physical Society newspaper</a>) and mathematics (see this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/the-odds-that-a-panel-would-randomly-be-all-men-are-astronomical/411505/"> article in The Verge</a>).
