        <p>
        Tech conference speaker line-ups frequently contain few or no women at
        all. It is sometimes argued that this is not the product of systemic
        discrimination but an inevitably frequent occurrence in an industry as
        male-dominated as ours. Human beings, however, are notoriously bad with
        probabilities. This calculator was inspired by comments from
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/4106776#comment-605425">Dave Wilkinson</a>
        and <a href="http://fberriman.com/2013/01/06/conferences-arent-the-problem/#comment-73943">Paul Battley</a>,
        who modelled the probability distribution for
        male/female speaker balance and found that the likelihood of an
        unbiased selection process yielding a line-up with no women at all is
        far lower than intuition might suggest, and&mdash;depending on the numbers
        you plug in&mdash;can often be far lower than the likelihood of their
        over-representation.

        The main caveat attached to this tool is that there&rsquo;s no
        obvious good value to use for the percentage of &ldquo;women in tech&rdquo;.
        Wilkinson used 20%, &ldquo;based off of Taubee studies and corroborated by
        other conferences that achieve speaker lineups with this distribution&rdquo;.
        Battley used 9.1%, based off the number of self-identified female developers in
        <a href="http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/01.html#gdbjt">A List
        Apart&rsquo;s annual survey</a>. 10% is used here as an arbitrary,
        conservative-feeling number.
